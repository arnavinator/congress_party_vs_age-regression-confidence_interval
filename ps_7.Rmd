## Question 1: Conduct exploratory data analysis

1a)
```{r p1, echo = FALSE}

# filtering data for both chambers of 116th congress, looking at only Dems and
# Reps. I use map to put a name to whether a congressman is Dem or Rep (but
# since I used map, I needed to unnest the list in order to see the values). I
# then calculated age of each congressman (subtracted birth year from 2019) and
# their percentile of nominate_dim1 (using function percent_rank and multiplying
# by 100 so that '50 is someone at the 50th percentile'). Finally, I selected
# for desired cols and used skim()

data %>% 
  filter(chamber == "Senate" | chamber == "House") %>% 
  filter(congress == 116) %>% 
  filter(party_code == 100 | party_code == 200) %>% 
  mutate(party = map(party_code, ~ ifelse(. == 100,
                                          "Democrat",
                                          "Republican")
                     )
  ) %>%
  unnest(party) %>% 
  mutate(age = 2019 - born) %>% 
  mutate(nominate_percentile = percent_rank(nominate_dim1)*100) %>% 
  select(nominate_percentile, age) %>% 
  skim()
  

```

```{r p2, echo = FALSE}
